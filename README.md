# Selenium Bot for Bachelors, masters and phdportal.com

This repository contains two Python scripts designed for scraping scholarship data from **BachelorsPortal.com**, **MastersPortal.com**, and **PhDPortal.com**. The project utilizes Selenium for browser automation and BeautifulSoup for additional parsing.

## **1. Scholarship Links.py**

### **Description**
This script extracts scholarship links from the websites mentioned above, organized by continent and country. The links are saved into separate CSV files for further data extraction.

### **Key Features**
- **Dynamic Navigation:** Handles pagination and clicks dynamically using Selenium.
- **Organized Output:** Stores links in CSV files grouped by continent and country.
- **Efficient Automation:** Uses `undetected_chromedriver` for seamless browsing.

### **Workflow**
1. Visits the target website.
2. Extracts scholarship links for specified continents and countries.
3. Handles pagination to ensure all links are collected.
4. Saves the data into CSV files.

### **Usage**
1. Update the file paths and continent/country list as needed.
2. Run the script to scrape and store links.

## **2. Scholarship Data.py**

### **Description**
This script extracts detailed scholarship information from the links obtained using *Scholarship Links.py*. The data is saved into structured CSV files.

### **Key Features**
- **Comprehensive Data Extraction:** Scrapes details such as scholarship title, provider, type, eligibility, location, and more.
- **Provider Email Extraction:** Retrieves email addresses from provider websites using BeautifulSoup and regex.
- **Dynamic Handling:** Manages popups and hidden elements efficiently.

### **Workflow**
1. Reads the CSV files generated by *Scholarship Links.py*.
2. Visits each scholarship link to extract details.
3. Handles popups for fields like eligibility and disciplines.
4. Saves the extracted data into categorized CSV files.

### **Output Structure**
- **Per Continent and Country:** CSV files are stored separately for each country under its respective continent folder.
- **Unified File:** A master CSV consolidates all extracted scholarship data.

### **Usage**
1. Ensure the input files (CSV) with links are in the specified directory structure.
2. Run the script to extract and save the scholarship details.
